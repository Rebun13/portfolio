        "Professionally, my main goal is to be a successful `videogame developer`. Currently I am working on little projects to learn theory and best practices on C++ and videogame deveopment in general. I am very interested on design and keeping my code clean, efficient and flexible, so I focus on good practices and programming patterns.",
