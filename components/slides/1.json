        "My name is `Rubén`, I'm 29 years old and was born in Pontevedra, Spain.",
        "I have plenty of hobbies: arts, tech, videogames, board games, politics, etc. But I ended up working as a `full stack Software Engineer`.",
        "For the last 2 years I have been studying to eventually become a `indie videogame developer`, which has been my dream for the last 10 years.",
        "I also enjoy drawing, something that I have done since I was a child. Of course, I would love to make this a job, but videogames are more appealing to me now."
