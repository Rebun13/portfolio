        "As I've written, I was born in `Pontevedra`, a quiet town where not much happens. I like that, but I have also wanted to look for a place that can give me something else.",
        "I also lived in `Ourense` for 2 years and a half; a nice place, but pretty similar to Pontevedra.",
        "During 5 months, in 2019, I also lived and studied in `Mikkeli, Finland`. There I found out I like to meet new places.",
        "Years later, during 2023 and 2024, I migrated to `Maynooth, Ireland`, looking for new opportunities. I learnt a lot during my stay there, and would love to come back in the future.",
        "Now, I am living in `Vilagarcia de Arousa`, but I am already thinking on my next destination (hopefully very far away). I miss getting to know new places and new people."
