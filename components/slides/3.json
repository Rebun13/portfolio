        "I tend to `trust people` because I think humans are naturally good. I like to be kind to people around me, and care about my friends and colleagues. Individualism has gone too far in today's world.",
        "In another topic, the struggle that matters most to me is `environmentalism`. I grew up in the countryside and have always been connected to nature, so I have been concerned about protecting it.",
        "I support other social causes, but I don't want to bore you `:P`"
