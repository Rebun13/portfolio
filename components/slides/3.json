        "I don't like individualism. I tend to `trust people` because I think humans are naturally good. This makes me always consider people around me, and care about my friends and colleagues.",
        "When I meet someone selfish or haughty, I tend to keep my distance. I prefer to keep my environment `calm and inspiring`.",
        "In another topic, the struggle that matters most to me is `environmentalism`. I grew up in the countryside and have always been connected to nature, so I have been concerned about protecting it."
